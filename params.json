{"name":"Ways-javascript","tagline":"[WAYS] Write As You Speak - Javascript Edition","body":"### WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT.\r\nComplex frameworks are all around and they're very cool. The simple tools however are not added to them. This first version (not WAYS but there must be a start for it) will cover all the basics of programming like loops, save and load data into localStorage and things like that.\nIn the next future when all the function are done I'll start to think how to make a cool parser line-by-line that can be write in plain english (yes, plain english is cool for non-developer or the tired one ;).\r\n\r\n### WHY THIS?\r\nWell, good programming is always a good way to code and reinvent the wheel is so boring that why not create a useful tool to work always with the same shortcut for basic stuff? Maybe this time you'll use things you usually don't use.\r\n\r\n### OK, NOW? WHERE I CAN USE THAT?\r\nWell, javascript is used to create a large variety of things, from website to app develop. You can use that for ANY kind of stuff.\r\n\r\n### WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF 'WAYS'?\r\n(@portapipe) will code the main class until lots of stuff will be added, THEN he'll start to think on how to integrate it into a cool and easy-for-all WAYS language (Write As You Speak), so plain English will be the main core of the language. The [Documentation](https://github.com/portapipe/WAYS-Javascript/wiki/Documentation) will help you to find out what you need to code without pain.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
